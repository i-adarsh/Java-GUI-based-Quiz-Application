In this Java Application, we have made a quiz application which can be used to take exams in colleges, schools, and etc. In this application, we have two panels:

1.  Admin Panel
2.  Student Panel

In admin panel, the admin is allowed to set exams of different types of subject whichever he wants also he/she can edit the paper whenever it required. Admin can also register new students and view marks of all the students who is given the exam.

The best part of this application is that, we donâ€™t have to create the results of the students. As, the student finishes the exam it will automatically generate the result and store it in the database. So, it reduces a lot of human efforts.

Talking, about Student Panel, in student panel the students are allowed to given the test, check his/her marks and also can change its password. And the best part of the student panel is the Exam Panel, in exam panel the student has to complete its test during a specific interval of time and if the student was unable to complete it on time and time completed then, the exam is automatically get submitted into the database. Once the exam of a particular subject and particular Exam-ID is submitted then the student is not allowed to appear for the same exam.

So, this application is also prevents from cheating in the examination.
